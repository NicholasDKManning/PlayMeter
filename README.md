# 🎮 PlayMeter

**PlayMeter** is a progressive web app (PWA) designed to help families track and manage earned video game time for kids. Children accumulate or lose game time based on tasks like completing chores, good behavior, or academic performance, all controlled through a clean and responsive dashboard interface.

This app is designed with two views:
- **Parent View**: Add or subtract time, set reasons, and manage children’s balances.
- **Kid View**: Read-only access to see available game time and history.
